She helps the whole team feel empowered to contribute toward building the best product --even if that means stepping outside of the discipline on your business card-- and she is an incredibly creative problem solver. She always keeps the team focused on what really matters: your users."

As a product manager and client facing team member, she's able to navigate tricky waters and troubleshoot urgent issues with grace. Given her extensive experience working at growing Silicon Valley companies, she's able to provide great insights into how to develop our team and office--and touches a lot of our initiatives around project deliver, hiring, and culture. Kathy would be a key hire at any organization and I'd be thrilled to work with her again."

She knows that behind a successful product is the team that builds it, and she does everything she can to set her teams up for success. She easily gains the respect from those who work with her. Any company she works for is very lucky to have her and I would love the chance to work with her again."

    "body": "Kathy is a rare product manager. She takes time to get a deep understanding of the business, and can develop and communicate both strategy and tactics to make sure that great products are built. Even more unusual, she knows how to toe the line between data and design in order to craft products that people want to use. She puts the needs of the company and the user first and foremost. Kathy also possesses the right temperament. She is great at building rapport with her team, possessing a wry wit and a level head even when her feet are held to the fire. She can communicate with developers, product managers, customers, and senior management alike. I feel extremely privileged to have worked with Kathy and can only hope that our paths will cross again in the future. Needless to say, I highly recommend Kathy for any senior position managing products, people or both."

Kathy has deep technical knowledge with a strong sense of responsibility for the customer. She has a keen ability to quickly wrap her expertise around a business problem and provide a solid product plan to address the issue. I had the pleasure of working with Kathy on our mobile product line. Shortly after joining, she quickly proved a number of our baseline assumptions were wrong and provided a product plan to address those issues. I was amazed at her skill of not only providing tractable solutions, but also how quickly she was able to get buy-in from the engineering teams. I highly recommend Kathy. She will bring clarity to your product lines, inspire your engineering team, and after a long day she's a blast to grab drinks with."

Kathy managed many clients with long, complex projects. She was a good advocate for Agile methodologies within a design agency that was struggling to \"get\" Agile. Kathy is very level-headed and often was helpful in diffusing difficult situations. I'd recommend her highly."

Simply stated, she is by far the most intelligent developer I've met. Within her first weeks at Hot, Kathleen was working on multiple projects. She gracefully absorbed complex (at times ill-defined) parameters and churned out amazing code; always clean, never arbitrary. Her contributions were immediately apparent (and billable). I'll be the first to say that while being pleasant is not requisite for a great developer, Kathleen certainly makes a compelling case. Maybe you'll be fortunate enough to meet her and find out for yourself."
