Product managers
----------------
- There are hundreds of methods for building products and running teams. As a quality PM, it's important to have an open mind about all of it, but finding your own process and philosophy can be grounding. It helps you find your pillars so that you don't smash into things while you're building. Remember, however, that you can always find budget for remodelling. ;-) 
- A good product manager spends time offline, authoring a vision and plan for the product. 
- First, ask questions and always assume you’re not the smartest person in the room. 
- Experience is built by continually shining the spotlight on challenges, risks, and failures and then making a plan to come out on the other side stronger, and better equipped.
- It’s always a good idea to take time to write a triage plan, and then keep it in your back pocket. 
- Getting dirty helps build empathy for teams and a clearer understanding of how a product works. 
- There is always room for improvement, staying humble helps keep us all curious so that week and watch for opportunities that make us better at building useful, good products.

Teams 
-----
- My teams aren't made up of designers, engineers, product managers, QA engineers, etc. They're made up product makers. Everyone should feel empowered to contribute to the process, vision, design, etc. (but know who your experts are and let them be that).
- A lot of chatter is a solid indication that your team is operating well. Silence is a scary, dark place that you want to get away from pronto.
- Teams operate better when they’re happy, but being afraid of disagreements is detrimental. Consensus is not always a good thing, bring boba tea if you have to. 
- The best designers are part engineers and vice-versa. 
- It's vital for team members to have empathy for other disciplines.
- Collaboration doesn't require a calendar invite; welcome impromptu face to face discussions and watch productivity escalate.

Products
--------
- Making a product better starts by examining the data, crafting hypotheses, and instrumenting smart analytics. 
- Good products don’t always start out looking good, but they do solve a problem for their users. 
- Design for the future, it'll be here before you know it.
- Analytics shouldn't build a product alone, but act a single factor that helps influence decisions.
- Good products can be made and great products are made and then refined over and over again - it sometimes feels like it's working just how the rock tumbler I had as a kid did. 

Users
-----
- How people use your product is different than how they say they use your product; know the difference. 
- Sometimes the best feedback will completely surprise you, and that’s a good thing. 
- Users have names, and email addresses; if you’re nice to them, they’ll give you feedback. 
- If you ask for information from a user, explain why you need it. If you don't need it, don't ask for it. 

Process
-----
- Product development process doesn't just happen, it's calculated and flexible. Refine your process as you go, but do it with intent and in collaboration with your team. 
- In a quality process, everyone on the team knows and understands their role from day one. If there are questions like, "what should I be working on," or "how do we resolve this disagreement," your team should know how to get the answer quickly so that they can commit to moving on and continuing to make the product. 
- If you keep a good eye on your process flow, chances are it's going to be easy to spot where it's breaking down. Useing tools to help unstick these areas are key: retro, MVS (minimum viable story) conversations, three amigos, pull request tsar, etc. 
- There's a forumla for standups: I'm working on X, I'm blocked/not blocked by Y, I'm going to be working on Z. But don't get in a standup rut. Add this question, "how are you feeling about the way things are working/going/running/etc. today?" Sometimes the details get lost between the lines, and it's very important to know how and when to bring those out (you'll be dealing with it one way or another, might as well be now). 
- The product rollout and launch process should be just as calculated as the one used to make the product.
