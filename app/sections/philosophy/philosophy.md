Product managers
----------------
- A good product manager spends time offline, authoring a vision and plan for the product. 
- First, ask questions and always assume you’re not the smartest person in the room. 
- Experience is built by continually shining the spotlight on challenges, risks, and failures and then making a plan to come out on the other side stronger, and better equipped.
- It’s always a good idea to take time to write a triage plan, and then keep it in your back pocket. 
- Getting dirty helps build empathy for teams and a clearer understanding of how a product works. 
- There is always room for improvement, staying humble helps keep us all curious so that week and watch for opportunities that make us better at building useful, good products.

Teams 
-----
- A lot of chatter is a solid indication that your team is operating well. Silence is a scary, dark place that you want to get away from pronto.
- Teams operate better when they’re happy, but being afraid of disagreements is detrimental. Consensus isn’t always a good thing, bring boba tea if you have to. 
- The best designers are part engineers and vice-versa. 
- It's vital for team members to have empathy for other disciplines.
- Collaboration doesn't require a calendar invite; welcome impromptu face to face discussions and watch productivity escalate.

Products
--------
- Making a product better starts by examining the data, crafting hypotheses, and instrumenting smart analytics. 
- Good products don’t always start out looking good, but they do solve a problem for their users. 
- Design for the future, it'll be here before you know it.
- Analytics shouldn't build a product alone, but act a single factor that helps influence decisions.

Users
-----
- How people use your product is different than how they say they use your product; know the difference. 
- Sometimes the best feedback will completely surprise you, and that’s a good thing. 
- Users have names, and email addresses, and if you’re nice to them, they’ll give you feedback. 
- If you ask for information from a user, explain why you need it. If you don't need it, don't ask for it.
