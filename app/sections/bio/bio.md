Hi! My name is Kathy. I’m from Alaska and I’m a product manager in San Francisco. I believe all great products come from a team effort that starts with a conversation. I've taken [many products](#shipped) from early prototypes to launch day. Through the successes (and the failures) I've developed a [philosophy](/philosophy) about the path we take to make products that shine. My process thrives on the delicate dance between data driven design, business goals, and user feedback. I've worked with a lot of [great people](#recs) through the years, and I'm looking for a new team to build interesting things. [Say hi](/contact) 👍😎.
